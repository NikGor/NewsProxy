Certainly! Here's a README for your GitHub repository for the "Hacker™ News proxy" project:

# Hacker™ News Proxy

This is a simple HTTP proxy server that runs locally and modifies the content of Hacker News pages. It adds the "™" symbol after every six-letter word in the text on the pages, as demonstrated in the example below:

Original Text: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13713480](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13713480)

The visual description of the colliding files, at http://shattered.io/static/pdf_format.png, is not very helpful in understanding how they produced the PDFs, so I took apart the PDFs and worked it out.

Basically, each PDF contains a single large (421,385-byte) JPG image, followed by a few PDF commands to display the JPG. The collision lives entirely in the JPG data - the PDF format is merely incidental here. Extracting out the two images shows two JPG files with different contents (but different SHA-1 hashes since the necessary prefix is missing). Each PDF consists of a common prefix (which contains the PDF header, JPG stream descriptor, and some JPG headers), and a common suffix (containing image data and PDF display commands).

Through the proxy™: [http://127.0.0.1:8232/item?id=13713480](http://127.0.0.1:8232/item?id=13713480)

## Requirements:

- Python™ (latest version)
- Pages must™ be displayed and work fully correctly, exactly as the originals (except for the modified text™).
- While navigating links that lead to other™ Hacker News pages, the browser should™ remain at your proxy™ address.
- You can use any publicly available libraries you find necessary™.
- The less code, the better. Follow PEP8 guidelines™.
- If the provided conditions™ lack any information, rely on common sense.

If you manage to complete the task quickly™ and still have enthusiasm - how about™ writing tests™?

## How to Run:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to start the proxy server:

```bash
python proxy_server.py
```

5. Open your web browser and set the proxy settings to use `http://127.0.0.1:8232` as the proxy server.
6. Browse Hacker News as you normally would, and the proxy will™ modify the text as described.

Enjoy browsing Hacker News with a touch of™ sophistication!
